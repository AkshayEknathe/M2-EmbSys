## Introduction/Abstract :- 
* Water is one of the most important resources on earth. Almost 70% of earth’s surface is covered with water from which 2% is fresh water. Now days everyone has a busyschedule which consumes the time for checking the water level at every instance. The project presents an idea of “Smart water Level Controller Using Arduino”. This project was carried out to make user’s life easy and time saving. The project includes the components such as relay and Arduino for controlling the pump to avoid the wastage of water.
* Smart water level controller senses the level of water in a tank and drives the water pump. Water level controllers switch the motor ON whenever the water level drops below a certain level and shuts the motor OFF when the water rises well above a fixed level. This circuit which will detect the water level and will Glow the Unique led colours to show the water level in the Tank.

## High Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|HLR01|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the level of water|
|HLR02|LED should glow|
|HLR03|Turn off the motor when water tank is Full|
|HLR04|Turn on the motor when water tank is empty|
## Low Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|LLR01|All the LEDs should glow  when Water Level iS between 0-25%|
|LLR02|Green,Yellow & Orange  LEDs should glow  when Water Level iS between 25%-50%|
|LLR03|Green & Yellow LEDs should glow  when Water Level iS between 50%-75%|
|LLR04|Green LED should glow  when Water Level is between 75%-100%|
# SWOT

![SWOT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98874290/157167000-0058b0ac-7342-43f8-a892-952d3dd361d3.png)

## Strength
* Very easy to use.
* Quick installtion.
* Less maintaince.
* Highly reliable and Economically competitive.
* Enhanced Security of Urban Water supply and Water use efficiency.
## Weakness
* Lack of graphical user interface.
* If the Ardunio gets reset the system will not work.
* System is very sensitive we have to handle it with care.
* The automatic water level controller shows poor durability.
## Opportunity
* Since now a days water usage is increasing so much it is very important to save the water so this kind of systems are required.
* Maximize Water supply Benefits and provide balanced allocation of water resources.
## Threats
* Fault in the circuit will cause problem in water supply.
* More advance technology is there to overcome this issue.
# 4W'S & 1H
## WHY
* A water level controller helps save money by limiting the waste of water and electricity.
## WHO
* Everyone can use this device as for their commercial aur domestic use.
## WHEN
* Whenerver the tank level gets low/high it starts and stops according to the requirements.
## WHAT
* Results into less manual work which saves human time and energy.
## HOW
* By setting these devices as per the requiement so as to save the loss of water and and save the motor from dry run and manual work load.
## Applications
* It can be widely used for the household purposes to avoid the wastage of water through the water tanks.
* It can be widely used in chemical industries to manage the liquid filled in the big tanks.
* It can be used in nuclear power plants as the water controlling systems is essential.
* It can be also used in the thermal power plants .
* It also finds a wide applications in the oil refineries industries.
* It can be used in dairy farms.
* It can be also used in water purification plant.
