# Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino.
## Introduction :- 
* Water is one of the most important resources on earth. Almost 70% of earth’s surface is covered with water from which 2% is fresh water. Now days everyone has a busyschedule which consumes the time for checking the water level at every instance. The project presents an idea of “Smart water Level Controller Using Arduino”. This project was carried out to make user’s life easy and time saving. The project includes the components such as relay and Arduino for controlling the pump to avoid the wastage of water.
* Automation of smart system is the essence of today's world. the “Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino ”, can be an appropriate example for the smart system. In the recent times due to to the huge scarcity of water resources frequent droughts have been occurring, due to which the various initiatives have been undertaken, out of which one is the system that will serve to save the water that is being wasted in the households, agriculture's and in different industries . some of the hazardous incidents such as the boiler bursts due to the lowering of the water level also can be avoided, which is also controlled by using this smart system.
