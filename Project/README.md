# Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino.
## Introduction :- 
Water is one of the most important resources on earth. Almost 70% of earth’s surface is covered with water from which 2% is fresh water. Now days everyone has a busyschedule which consumes the time for checking the water level at every instance. The project presents an idea of “Smart water Level Controller Using Arduino”. This project was carried out to make user’s life easy and time saving. The project includes the components such as relay and Arduino for controlling the pump to avoid the wastage of water.
