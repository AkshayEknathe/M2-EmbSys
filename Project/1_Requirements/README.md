# Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino
## Introduction : -
* Automation of smart system is the essence of today's world. the “Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino ”, can be an appropriate example for the smart system. In the recent times due to to the huge scarcity of water resources frequent droughts have been occurring, due to which the various initiatives have been undertaken, out of which one is the system that will serve to save the water that is being wasted in the households, agriculture's and in different industries . some of the hazardous incidents such as the boiler bursts due to the lowering of the water level also can be avoided, which is also controlled by using this smart system.
## High Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|HLR01|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the level of water|
|HLR02|LED should glow|
|HLR03|Turn off the motor when water tank is Full|
|HLR04|Turn on the motor when water tank is empty|
## Low Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|LLR01|LED should glow Red when valve is open|
|LLR02|LED should glow green when valve is closed|
|LLR03|It shall display that weather the motor is running or not|
|LLR04|It shall display the status of PowerSupply if it is on or off|
# SWOT
## Strength
* Very easy to use.
* Quick installtion.
* Very Reliable.
* Less maintaince.
## Weakness
* Lack of graphical user interface.
* If the Ardunio gets reset the system will not work.
* System is very sensitive we have to handle it with care.
## Opportunity
* Since now a days water usage is increasing so much it is very important to save the water so this kind of systems are required.
## Threats
* More advance technology is there to overcome this issue.
# 4W'S & 1H
## WHY
* A water level controller helps save money by limiting the waste of water and electricity.
## WHO
* Everyone can use this device as for their commercial aur domestic use.
## WHEN
* Whenerver the tank level gets low/high it starts and stops according to the requirements.
## WHAT
* Results into less manual work which saves human time and energy.
## HOW
* By setting these devices as per the requiement so as to save the loss of water and and save the motor from dry run and manual work load.
## Applications
* It can be widely used for the household purposes to avoid the wastage of water through the water tanks.
* It can be widely used in chemical industries to manage the liquid filled in the big tanks.
* It can be used in nuclear power plants as the water controlling systems is essential.
* It can be also used in the thermal power plants .
* It also finds a wide applications in the oil refineries industries.
* It can be used in dairy farms.
* It can be also used in water purification plant.
