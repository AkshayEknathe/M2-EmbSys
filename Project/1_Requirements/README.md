# Smart Water Level Controller Using Arduino
## Introduction : -
* Automation of smart system is the essence of today's world. the “Smart Liquid Level Controller Using Arduino with an SMS Alert”, can be an appropriate example for the smart system. In the recent times due to to the huge scarcity of water resources frequent droughts have been occurring, due to which the various initiatives have been undertaken, out of which one is the system that will serve to save the water that is being wasted in the households, agriculture's and in different industries . some of the hazardous incidents such as the boiler bursts due to the lowering of the water level also can be avoided, which is also controlled by using this smart system.
## High Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|HLR01|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the level of water|
|HLR02|LED should glow RED/GREEN|
|HLR03|Servo Motor Should ON/OFF|
|HLR04|Voltmeter should measure the voltage|
|HLR05|Potentiometer should regulate the voltage properly|
## Low Level Requirements
|ID|Description|
|----|------|
|LLR01|LED should glow Red when valve is open|
|LLR02|LED should glow green when valve is closed|
|LLR03|Servo motor valve should close when water is full|
|LLR04|Servo motor valve should be open when the water is less|
