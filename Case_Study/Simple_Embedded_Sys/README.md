## Introduction
* A digital tachometer is a digital device that measures and indicates the speed of a rotating object. A rotating object may be a bike tire, a car tire or a ceiling fan, or any other motor, and so on. A digital tachometer circuit comprises LCD or LED readout and a memory for storage. Digital tachometers are more common these days and they provide numerical readings instead of dials and needles.
* A digital tachometer is an optical encoder that determines the angular velocity of a rotating shaft or motor. Digital tachometers are used in different applications such as automobiles, airplanes, and medical and instrumentation applications.
## Components
* Optical Sensor:- An optical sensor consists of an optical diskplaced near the motor which generate pulses proportional to therotating shaft. A slotted disk and IR emitter are used to generate these pulses.
