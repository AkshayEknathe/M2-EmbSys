## Components
# Microcontroller :-
 The converted binary data from the A/D converter is applied to microcontroller.The microcontroller reads binary data from A/D converter,convert it to suitable form and performs different operations based on the value of temperature read from A/D converter.
# Temperature sensor :- 
The temperature sensor gives the analog output voltage based on the temperature of the room.
# A/D converter :-
This analog voltage is fed to the A/D converter.The A/D converter then converts the analog input voltage from the temperature sensor into equivalent binary bits.
# LCD display :
The LCD is used to display the data given by microcontroller.
# optocoupler:-
Microcontroller can turn on dc fan through the optocoupler if required.
